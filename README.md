# malaria-Project-District-Wise
# Simple Malaria Dashboard (Bhutan)

This is a small project I made to learn Streamlit and data visualization.

The dashboard shows:
- malaria indicators of Bhutan
- bar and line charts for each indicator
- a simple Bhutan district map

## How to run

1. Install the requirements:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Run the app:
   streamlit run app.py

## Data Files
I kept both data files inside /data folder:
- malaria_indicators_btn.csv
- bhutan_districts.json

This project is only for learning/practice. I will try to improve it later.
